<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Q: Do I need to use thermal paste when installing a CPU?  A: Yes, thermal paste is necessary to ensure proper heat transfer between the CPU and the heatsink or cooling solution. It helps prevent overheating and maintains optimal performance. Apply a small amount of thermal paste evenly on the CPU surface before installing the cooler.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Q: How can I troubleshoot if my newly built computer won't start?  A: Double-check all connections, including power cables, RAM, and GPU. Ensure that the power supply is switched on and providing enough power for the components. Verify that the RAM and GPU are properly seated in their slots. If the problem persists, remove non-essential components and try booting with minimal hardware to isolate any faulty parts.</p>
  </li>

    <p>Q: My computer is turning on, but I don't see anything on the screen. What should I do?  A: Check that the monitor is properly connected and powered on. Ensure that the video cable is securely plugged into the GPU or motherboard, depending on your setup. If you have a dedicated GPU, make sure it is properly seated in the PCIe slot. If using integrated graphics, ensure the CPU supports it and that you're connected to the appropriate video output.</p>

    <p>Q: I've finished building my computer, but it's overheating. What could be the issue?  A: Overheating can be caused by inadequate cooling or improper airflow. Ensure that the CPU cooler is properly mounted with sufficient thermal paste. Make sure all case fans are functioning correctly and that the airflow is unobstructed. Consider adding more fans or upgrading to a more efficient cooling solution.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Q: My newly built computer keeps crashing or experiencing errors. What should I do?  A: Crashes and errors can be caused by various factors, such as incompatible or faulty components, driver issues, or RAM problems. Update all drivers to the latest versions and ensure that all components are compatible with each other and the operating system. Test the RAM using memory diagnostic tools to rule out any issues.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Q: Can I overclock my newly built computer for better performance?  A: Overclocking can provide performance boosts, but it requires careful consideration and knowledge. Ensure that your components support overclocking and that your cooling solution is sufficient to handle the increased heat. Research proper overclocking techniques, adjust settings gradually, and stress test your system to ensure stability and reliability.</p>
